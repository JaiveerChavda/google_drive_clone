# Google Drive Clone - A VILT stack project

## A fully Functional Google Drive like clone project written using php powered Laravel and VueJs a javascript framework paired by InertiaJs


This project is an example that, i am building along with a [Youtube Series](https://youtu.be/Wn3IPX_ax-0?si=2r1DTZTsJqVCuo6k) which shows how to create a file and folder management app like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/drive/). Building this project is in my wishlist from long time , this will parallely increase my frontend and backend skill like from biulding interactive UI, beautiful components and eye catching design to handling large file storage operations, architecturing complex schemas and developing awesome features.
